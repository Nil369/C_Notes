<h3>
1.  Developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s.
  
2.  Known for its efficiency, simplicity, and low-level system access.
   
3.  Follows a procedural programming paradigm.
   
4.  Focuses on functions and structured programming.
   
5.  Highly portable language, allowing programs written in C to run on different platforms with minimal modifications.
   
6.  C uses a syntax that includes variables, data types, operators, and control structures (loops and conditionals).

7.  To run C/C++ in your system you need 2 things:
          <h4> ► MinGW compiler => Just search mingw compiler downloader in google => Install it & then set the environment variable by giving the compiler path </h4>
          <h4> ► Code Editor/ IDE => Download VS Code </h4><p>I know many people will suggest you to install DevC++/ Turbo C ... But all of these are discontinuos software</p>

<h1>How is it different from C++?</h1>
<h3>

►  The syntax of C++ is almost identical to that of C, as C++ was developed as an extension of C.

►  In contrast to C, C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not.

►  C gives most of the control to the hand of users. Things like memory allocation and manipulation are totally in the hands of the programmer. Being a flexible language, it provides more access to the programmer because of which it is more efficient.

►  C is POP(procedure oriented programming) whereas c++ is OOP(Object oriented programming)
